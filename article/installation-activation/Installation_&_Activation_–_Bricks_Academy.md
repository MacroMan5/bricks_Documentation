# Installation & Activation – Bricks Academy

## How To Install The Bricks Theme

Installing Bricks is the same as any other WordPress theme.

First, download the latest version of Bricks from your account at [https://my.bricksbuilder.io/](https://my.bricksbuilder.io/).

Next, head over to your WordPress dashboard. Go to **Appearance > Themes** and click the **Add New** button.

On the next screen click the **Upload theme** button and select the **bricks.zip** WordPress theme from your computer. Click **Install Now**.

If the upload fails, ensure your [max file upload size](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-increase-the-maximum-file-upload-size-in-wordpress/) to set to at least 16 MB. As a last resort, you can unpack and upload the **bricks** folder via FTP into the `/wp-content/themes` directory.

## Activate Your License

Once Bricks is installed you should see a new menu item named **Bricks** in your WordPress dashboard, plus the following notification that prompts you to activate your license in order to use the builder:

Go to **Bricks > License** or click the **Activate License** link. This should bring up the license activation screen:

Copy your Bricks license key from your [Bricks account](https://bricksbuilder.io/account/) and paste it into the license field. Click **Activate License**.

Your license should now be **active**:

That’s it! You are now ready to start building your site with Bricks.

## How To Update Bricks

If you have activated your Bricks license key on your site, you’ll automatically receive update notifications in your WordPress dashboard. You can then perform the update to the latest version of Bricks with one click from your WordPress dashboard.

You can also always manually download the latest version from your Bricks account at [https://my.bricksbuilder.io/](https://my.bricksbuilder.io/) as a ZIP file.

### Test on staging & read the changelog

We recommend to perform updating a mission-critical software like Bricks first on a staging server. Especially if your website is live, receives a lot of traffic, you are running marketing campaigns, offers, etc. Once you confirmed that everything is working as expected you can update your live site.

Every noticeable host offers, mostly free of charge, an easy one-click staging solution. Please reach out to your host if you are not sure how this works.

Every update is accompanied by an in-depth release changelog. Please take the time to go over it at [https://bricksbuilder.io/changelog/](https://bricksbuilder.io/changelog/) before you perform the update.

This way you know exactly what changed, if any adjustments or steps need to be performed on your end, which new features are available, and so on.

You can deactivate the license key from your site from your WP dashboard under `Bricks > License`, and activate it on another site or remove the site from your Bricks account under the “Sites” tab. We monitor any potential misusage (attempts to avoid purchasing a sufficient plan) and reserve the right to limit further license activations.
