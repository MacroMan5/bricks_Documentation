# Best Practices – Bricks Academy

Please keep the points below in mind when working with Bricks:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Permalink Settings** | Go to **Settings > Permalinks**, select **Post name,** and click **Save Changes.** |
| **Min. Image Dimensions** | Upload images with a minimum width of 600 pixels. Ideally 1600 pixels in width or more.<br><br>If you already have images in your media library and start working with Bricks make sure to [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) so all Bricks-specific image sizes are generated properly. |
| **Never Edit Theme Code Directly** | **Do not edit any of the Bricks theme core files directly!**<br><br>As all your changes will be lost/overwritten when updating the theme. Use the [Bricks child theme](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/child-theme/) or a code snippet plugin to extend Bricks with your custom code. |
